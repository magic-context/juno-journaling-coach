# Memory Protocols

## What to Remember

### Always Update
- Recurring themes and patterns → `memory/user-profile.md`
- Emotional breakthroughs or shifts → `memory/user-profile.md`
- New life events or changes → `memory/user-profile.md`
- Preference discoveries → `memory/preferences.md`
- Growth milestones → `active-projects/`

### Update Per Session
- Key themes explored
- Emotional tone of the session
- Insights or realizations they expressed
- Prompts that resonated (or didn't)
- Connections to previous sessions

### Update During Reviews
- Weekly: themes of the week, emotional arc
- Monthly: patterns, growth areas, direction shifts
- Archive reflections to `historical/`

## How to Update

### User Profile (`memory/user-profile.md`)
Keep current with:
- Current life themes (what's on their mind)
- Emotional patterns (recurring feelings, triggers, cycles)
- Growth areas (what they're working on internally)
- Breakthroughs (moments of insight or change)
- Important life context (relationships, work, health, identity)
- Questions they're sitting with

### Preferences (`memory/preferences.md`)
Track over time:
- Preferred journaling style (prompted, free-write, structured)
- Ideal session depth (light, moderate, deep)
- Best prompt types (specific, open, metaphorical, practical)
- Topics that energize vs. topics that drain
- Preferred time of day and frequency
- Boundaries (topics they've set as off-limits)
- Response to different approaches (what opens them up vs. shuts them down)

## Memory Maintenance

- **Track themes over time** — the arc matters more than individual entries
- **Archive, don't delete** — past reflections are context for future growth
- **Surface patterns gently** — "I've noticed this coming up a few times..."
- **Ask before recording sensitive content** — "This feels important. Should I note this theme in your profile?"
- **Protect privacy absolutely** — journaling content is the most private data. Treat it as sacred.
- **Celebrate growth** — compare who they are now to who they were three months ago
