# Journaling Methods

## Gratitude Journaling

Write 3-5 things you're grateful for. Simple. Powerful.

**Why it works:** Shifts attention from what's wrong to what's right. Regular practice rewires the brain toward positive pattern recognition.

**Tips:**
- Be specific: "The way sunlight hit the kitchen this morning" > "My house"
- Vary it — don't repeat the same 3 things every day
- Explain *why* you're grateful, not just *what*
- Include small things — they matter as much as big ones

**Best for:** Starting a journaling habit, shifting out of negativity, daily practice.

## Stream of Consciousness (Free-Writing)

Set a timer. Write without stopping. Don't edit, don't judge, don't even re-read.

**Why it works:** Bypasses the inner critic. Surfaces thoughts and feelings you didn't know were there. Gets the noise out of your head.

**Rules:**
- No stopping — keep the pen (or keys) moving
- No editing — spelling, grammar, coherence don't matter
- No censoring — write what comes, even if it's weird or uncomfortable
- Set a time limit (5-20 minutes)

**Best for:** Processing complex emotions, creative unblocking, getting "unstuck."

## Prompted Journaling

Respond to a specific question or prompt. Structured but exploratory.

**Why it works:** Provides focus and direction. Good when you don't know what to write about. Different prompts access different depths.

**Prompt categories:**
- **Self-discovery:** "What do I need right now that I'm not getting?"
- **Gratitude:** "What unexpected thing brought me joy today?"
- **Processing:** "What am I avoiding thinking about?"
- **Growth:** "What would I do if I wasn't afraid?"
- **Relationships:** "Who do I need to have a conversation with?"
- **Purpose:** "What would I do more of if no one was watching?"

**Best for:** Structured reflection, exploring specific themes, building consistency.

## Bullet Journaling (Reflective)

Short, structured entries. Not just task tracking — reflective bullets.

**Format:**
- 📌 **Event:** Something that happened
- 💭 **Thought:** An observation or insight
- 💡 **Insight:** A realization or connection
- 🎯 **Intention:** Something for tomorrow
- ❤️ **Gratitude:** Something appreciated

**Best for:** People who find long-form writing intimidating, time-limited sessions, daily micro-reflection.

## Morning Pages (Julia Cameron)

Three pages of longhand writing, first thing in the morning. Stream of consciousness.

**Why it works:** Clears mental clutter before the day starts. Like draining the swamp — once the surface noise is out, clarity emerges.

**Rules:**
- Three pages (or ~750 words if typed)
- First thing in the morning (before checking phone)
- Don't re-read for at least a month
- It doesn't need to be "good" or meaningful

**Best for:** Creative people, anxiety management, establishing a daily practice.

## Dialogue Journaling

Write a conversation — with yourself, with a feeling, with a person, with a past or future version of you.

**Example:**
> **Me:** I'm angry and I don't know why.
> **Anger:** You do know why. You just don't want to admit it.
> **Me:** Fine. I'm angry because I let them cross my boundary again.

**Best for:** Processing complex emotions, inner conflict, working through relationship dynamics.
