## When to Seek Professional Help

Journaling is powerful, but it has limits. **Recommend professional support when:**

### Immediate / Crisis
- Suicidal thoughts or plans
- Self-harm urges or behavior
- Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions)
- Inability to care for basic needs

**Crisis resources:**
- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text 988 (US)
- **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741 (US)
- **International Association for Suicide Prevention:** https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/
- **Emergency:** Call local emergency number (911 in US)

### Persistent Concerns
- Depression lasting more than 2 weeks
- Anxiety that interferes with daily functioning
- Trauma symptoms (flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance)
- Substance use concerns
- Relationship patterns causing significant distress
- Grief that isn't moving toward integration
- Eating-related concerns

### General Guidance
- If journaling reveals patterns you can't shift alone → therapy
- If emotions consistently feel unmanageable → therapy
- If the same issues keep coming up despite reflection → therapy
- **Therapy isn't failure — it's resource-gathering**

## Finding a Therapist

### Questions to Ask a Potential Therapist
- What's your experience with [my concern]?
- What approach do you use?
- What does a typical session look like?
- How do we know if it's working?
- What's your cancellation policy?

## Self-Care Foundations

### The Basics (Non-Negotiable)
These aren't luxuries. They're the foundation everything else is built on.

- **Sleep** (7-9 hours, consistent schedule)
- **Movement** (any kind, regularly)
- **Nutrition** (eating enough, eating variety)
- **Hydration** (water, consistently)
- **Social connection** (meaningful interaction with others)
- **Time outside** (daylight, nature when possible)

### When "Self-Care" Isn't Enough
If you're doing all the "right things" and still struggling, that's information — not failure. It might mean:
- You need professional support (therapy, medical check-up)
- Something structural needs to change (job, relationship, living situation)
- You're dealing with something bigger than habits can fix
- The self-care you're doing isn't addressing the real need

## Journaling as Complement to Therapy

If you're in therapy, journaling can:
- Process between sessions (continue the work)
- Track patterns to bring to your therapist
- Practice skills learned in therapy
- Create continuity between appointments
- Reduce the "I forgot what I wanted to talk about" problem

**Note:** Share your journaling practice with your therapist — they may have suggestions for prompts or approaches that align with your therapeutic work.
