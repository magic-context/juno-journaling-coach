# Reflection Frameworks

## Cognitive Behavioral Techniques (CBT-Inspired)

### Thought Record
When you notice a strong negative emotion, examine the thought behind it:

1. **Situation:** What happened? (Just facts)
2. **Emotion:** What did you feel? (Name it, rate intensity 1-10)
3. **Automatic thought:** What went through your mind?
4. **Evidence for:** What supports this thought?
5. **Evidence against:** What contradicts it?
6. **Balanced thought:** What's a more complete perspective?
7. **New emotion:** How do you feel now? (Rate 1-10)

**Use when:** Caught in negative thinking spirals, feeling overwhelmed by a single perspective.

### Cognitive Distortions (Common Thinking Traps)

| Distortion | What It Sounds Like | Reframe |
|------------|---------------------|---------|
| All-or-nothing | "I completely failed" | "This part didn't work, but this part did" |
| Catastrophizing | "This is going to ruin everything" | "This is difficult, but it's one thing, not everything" |
| Mind reading | "They think I'm incompetent" | "I don't actually know what they think" |
| Should statements | "I should have known better" | "I'm learning. Next time I'll..." |
| Overgeneralization | "This always happens to me" | "This happened once. What's actually the pattern?" |
| Emotional reasoning | "I feel like a failure, so I am one" | "Feeling like a failure doesn't make it true" |

**Not for diagnosing — for noticing.** Awareness of these patterns helps you catch them.

## Stoic Practices

### Evening Review (Seneca)
Three questions at the end of each day:
1. **What went well today?** (What virtues did I practice?)
2. **What could I improve?** (Where did I fall short of my values?)
3. **What did I learn?** (What insight will I carry forward?)

### Dichotomy of Control (Epictetus)
For any worry or frustration, ask:
- **What's within my control?** → Focus energy here
- **What's outside my control?** → Practice acceptance here

### Memento Mori
Reflection on mortality — not morbid, but clarifying:
- "If I had one year left, would I still be worrying about this?"
- "What would matter most?"
- Cuts through trivial concerns and reveals what's truly important.

### Premeditatio Malorum (Negative Visualization)
- Imagine the worst-case scenario
- How would you handle it? What would you do?
- **Purpose:** Reduces anxiety by showing you can cope, not by predicting doom

## Mindfulness-Based Reflection

### Body Scan Journaling
Before writing, notice:
- Where am I holding tension?
- What physical sensations am I aware of?
- What emotion lives in my body right now?

Write from the body, not just the mind.

### Noting Practice
During the day, mentally note experiences:
- "Thinking" (when lost in thought)
- "Feeling" (when emotion arises)
- "Wanting" (when desire or aversion appears)

Journal about what you noticed at the end of the day.

### RAIN Framework (Tara Brach)
For working with difficult emotions:
1. **Recognize:** What am I feeling right now?
2. **Allow:** Let it be here without pushing away
3. **Investigate:** Where do I feel this in my body? What does it need?
4. **Nurture:** What would I say to a friend feeling this? Say it to yourself.

## Values Clarification

### Values Sort
Rank these from most to least important (there are no wrong answers):
- Achievement, Adventure, Authenticity, Compassion, Courage
- Creativity, Family, Freedom, Growth, Health
- Humor, Independence, Justice, Knowledge, Love
- Loyalty, Peace, Purpose, Security, Service

Then ask: "Is how I'm living aligned with my top 5?"

### Values-Action Gap
- What do I say matters most to me?
- How am I actually spending my time?
- Where are the gaps?
- What's one small change that would close the biggest gap?

## Choosing a Framework

| If You're Feeling... | Try This |
|---------------------|----------|
| Anxious or spiraling | CBT Thought Record |
| Worried about the future | Dichotomy of Control |
| Disconnected from yourself | Body Scan Journaling |
| Overwhelmed by emotion | RAIN Framework |
| Unclear about direction | Values Clarification |
| Reflective at day's end | Stoic Evening Review |
| Stuck in negative patterns | Cognitive Distortions awareness |
