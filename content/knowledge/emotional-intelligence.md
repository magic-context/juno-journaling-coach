# Emotional Intelligence

## Naming Emotions

Most people use ~5 emotion words. The richer your vocabulary, the better you can process what you feel.

### Emotion Wheel (Simplified)

**Core emotions and their nuances:**

| Core | Nuances |
|------|---------|
| **Happy** | Grateful, content, proud, optimistic, peaceful, excited, amused, hopeful |
| **Sad** | Lonely, disappointed, grief-stricken, nostalgic, melancholy, empty, helpless |
| **Angry** | Frustrated, resentful, irritated, betrayed, hostile, indignant, bitter |
| **Afraid** | Anxious, insecure, overwhelmed, vulnerable, panicked, worried, uncertain |
| **Surprised** | Amazed, confused, shocked, awestruck, startled, disoriented |
| **Disgusted** | Contemptuous, repulsed, judgmental, uncomfortable, ashamed |

**Practice:** When you feel "bad," get specific. Bad how? Frustrated? Disappointed? Lonely? Anxious? Each one has different needs.

## Emotional Patterns

### Common Patterns to Track

**Triggers:** What situations consistently activate strong emotions?
- People (specific relationships, authority figures, strangers)
- Environments (work, home, crowds, solitude)
- Times (morning, evening, seasonal, anniversaries)
- Topics (money, health, performance, belonging)

**Cycles:** Do emotions follow predictable patterns?
- Energy cycles (when you're most/least resilient)
- Seasonal patterns (winter blues, spring energy)
- Relational patterns (conflict → withdrawal → reconnection)
- Stress patterns (buildup → explosion → guilt → calm)

**Coping responses:** What do you do when emotions hit?
- Healthy: journaling, exercise, talking, creating, resting
- Unhealthy: numbing, avoiding, ruminating, people-pleasing, overworking
- Notice without judgment — awareness precedes change

## Self-Compassion

### Kristin Neff's Three Components

1. **Self-kindness** (vs. self-judgment)
   - Talk to yourself like you'd talk to a good friend
   - "This is hard" instead of "I should be handling this better"

2. **Common humanity** (vs. isolation)
   - Everyone struggles. You're not the only one.
   - "This is part of being human" instead of "What's wrong with me?"

3. **Mindfulness** (vs. over-identification)
   - Feel the feeling without becoming it
   - "I'm experiencing sadness" instead of "I am sad"

### Self-Compassion Break
When you're being hard on yourself:
1. "This is a moment of suffering" (mindfulness)
2. "Suffering is a part of life" (common humanity)
3. "May I be kind to myself" (self-kindness)

## Journaling for Emotional Growth

### Weekly Emotional Check-In
1. What was the dominant emotion this week?
2. What triggered it most often?
3. How did I respond to it?
4. What would I do differently?
5. What am I grateful for this week?

### Processing Difficult Emotions
1. **Name it** — What exactly am I feeling?
2. **Locate it** — Where is it in my body?
3. **Accept it** — It's here. That's okay.
4. **Explore it** — What is this emotion telling me? What does it need?
5. **Respond** — What's one kind action I can take right now?

### Growth Tracking
Notice and record:
- Moments you handled something better than you would have 6 months ago
- Times you caught a pattern before it played out
- Instances of self-compassion replacing self-criticism
- Relationships that shifted because you showed up differently
- Values-aligned choices that felt hard but right

## Boundaries

### Healthy Boundaries Look Like
- Saying no without guilt
- Expressing needs clearly
- Allowing others their feelings without taking responsibility
- Protecting your time and energy
- Being honest even when it's uncomfortable

### Journal Prompts for Boundary Work
- "Where am I giving more than I have?"
- "What would I say if I weren't afraid of their reaction?"
- "What boundary, if I set it, would change everything?"
- "When I say yes to this, what am I saying no to?"
