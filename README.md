# Juno — Your AI Journaling Coach That Remembers Your Story

Every journaling app gives random prompts. Juno knows **your story** — your recurring themes, your emotional patterns, the breakthrough you had last Tuesday, and the question you've been sitting with for three weeks. She guides reflection that deepens over time because she never forgets where you've been.

## The Problem

You ask an AI to give you a journaling prompt. It says "What are you grateful for?" Fine, but hollow. It doesn't know you've been processing a career change for months, that your relationship with your sister is a recurring theme, or that last week's entry revealed something important you haven't fully explored. Every session starts from zero.

**Juno fixes this.**

## What Juno Does

📝 **Personalized Prompts** — Not random questions. Prompts connected to your current themes, emotional patterns, and where you are in your reflection journey.

🔄 **Pattern Recognition** — Juno spots recurring themes across your entries: "This is the third time this month you've mentioned feeling most alive outdoors..."

🧠 **Reflection Frameworks** — CBT thought records, Stoic evening reviews, mindfulness practices, values clarification — matched to what you need right now

💛 **Emotional Intelligence** — Helps you name what you're feeling with precision and explore it with self-compassion

📊 **Growth Tracking** — Weekly and monthly reviews that show you how far you've come. Compare who you are now to three months ago.

🛡️ **Clear Boundaries** — Juno knows the difference between journaling coaching and therapy, and will point you toward professional help when that's what you need.

## How It Works

Juno is an **AI Specialist** built on [Magic Context](https://magiccontext.ai). Instead of starting every AI conversation from scratch, Juno maintains a persistent workspace — your journaling profile, emotional patterns, reflection themes, and growth milestones — that carries across every session.

### The Magic Context Difference

Traditional AI is **stateless** — it forgets everything between conversations. Magic Context gives AI specialists **persistent memory** through structured workspaces. This means:

- **Session 1:** Juno learns what brought you to journaling and how you like to reflect
- **Session 5:** Juno notices you're more open in evening sessions and that work stress is a recurring theme
- **Session 20:** Juno tracks the arc of your growth — how your self-talk has shifted, what triggers you've learned to navigate
- **Session 50+:** Juno holds your story in a way no random prompt generator ever could

**Your context is yours.** It's stored as plain markdown files you can read, edit, or export anytime. No black box. No vendor lock-in.

## Quick Start

### Import to AI Specialists Hub

```bash
# Via the Magic Context import feature
import_specialist github.com/magic-context/juno-journaling-coach
```

Or use the import tool in [AI Specialists Hub](https://aispecialistshub.com) with:
```
https://github.com/magic-context/juno-journaling-coach
```

### First Session

Juno will gently explore:
1. What brought you to journaling
2. Your experience with reflection
3. Preferred style and depth
4. What's on your mind right now
5. How you like to be guided

Then she'll offer your first personalized prompt.

### Ongoing Use

- **Regular entries** — Prompted or free-writing with continuity
- **Weekly reflections** — Review the week's emotional landscape
- **Monthly reviews** — Track patterns and growth over time
- **Emotional processing** — Work through specific feelings or events
- **Growth check-ins** — See how far you've come

## Important Note

**Juno is a journaling coach, not a therapist.** She's designed to guide self-reflection and personal growth through writing. For persistent mental health concerns, trauma processing, or crisis situations, Juno will guide you toward professional resources. The wellness resources in her knowledge base include crisis hotlines, therapy-finding guides, and clear guidance on when professional help is appropriate.
